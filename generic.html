									<h3>A Data Science & AI Enthusiast, Mathematician. A Trained Graduate Teacher(Mathematics & Stastistics) </h3>

								<p>Hi, it's Subhradipta. A guy who is passionate and interested about AI since the college days. The use of AI in almost every aspect of our life surprises me a lot. I wonder how a man made machine can just do this amount of work just by itself. </p>
								<p>Since my school days I had a passion for teaching also. But during my Graduation I became obssed with all these AI n all. I started to do a lot of google and research on the work on Artificial Inteligence. The sci-fi hollywood movies also pushed me a lot to gain knowledge in this area. Then I came to know that the source or the fuel for the AI to become this much efitient is noting but the data collected from our day to day life. </p>
								<p>Then I started to realize that this is a data driven world, and to know more about AI and to dive into the field of Artificial Inteligence, I need to learn a lot. from this thought my data science journey has been started. In Robotic Surgey, Segementation algorithm is used and the machine has been trained on over thousands of segmented images. Similarly in astronomy, and alsomt each n every field of work AI is a game changer and in recent future therer will be a lot of demand in this field, and hence ence I've deided to switch my carrer in the field of AI and become a Data Scientist.</p>
								<p>In the mean time I've also cherished my passion for teaching. I've gained expirence in teaching Mathematics and Statistics for more than 4 years. Currently I'm working as a Mathematics Teacher in Focussed Seven Tutorials, a online educational institute which provides tuition the students upto 12th.</p>
								<p>I love to build application in Machine learning and Deep Learning. I have made several application in this field, some of which you can see in previous page. I have completed my Graduation under University of calcutta, in Mathematics Hons. with Statistics and physics. Now I am looking for a job to kickstart my carrer in the field of AI and Data Science, where I can grow my knowledge and work in an environment that
									encourages me to succeed and grow professionally and utilize my skills and knowledge appropriately. </p>
